# Employee-Roster-Template

This program will allow the manager of a workplace to easily create a roster of their employees.

The program will prompt the manager for their information including their name, email, ID number and office number.

After the manager enters their information, the are asked if they would like to add an employee and which kind of employee to add, Engineer or intern. Based upon the answer to this question, the manager will be prompted for questions about the employee's name, email, ID number and either their GitHub username (Engineer) or school (intern).

Once the manager has inputted all of their employees information, a styled html document is created for them displaying each employee with the appropriate information.
